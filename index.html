            <h1>Hi, my love</h1>
            <p>Happy Anniversary, baby! It's been exactly 1 year since you've said yes to me and since that day I have never thought that I regret asking you that question. In 1 year, we've experienced a lot of things, iykyk hehehe. May gin pakita ka sakon nga tiktok few days ago that before a person dies, ga recall sa sang life ya within 7 mins, like memories lang nga indi ya malimtan and I was thinking, that could be my new goal, to create memories with you that you will recall in your last 7mins here on earth. This might sound morbid, but I just want to show how important the memories that we create. Happy Anniversary, baby. I love you so much!</p>
